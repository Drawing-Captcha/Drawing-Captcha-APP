## Description

Drawing Captcha is an innovative and engaging software designed to verify human users through interactive drawing tasks. üñåÔ∏è Users are prompted to complete specific patterns or color in logos on a grid, ensuring a secure üîí and enjoyable üòä verification process. This unique approach not only enhances security but also promotes brand awareness by incorporating recognizable brand elements into the captchas.

With Drawing Captcha, you can easily create, modify, and design your own captchas to suit your specific needs. üõ†Ô∏è The user-friendly interface allows for a seamless experience, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. Whether you want to enhance security, boost brand recognition, or simply provide a fun user interaction, Drawing Captcha is the perfect solution. üé®

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### Usage with Docker / Docker-Compose

1. Clone this project:
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/wpesicDev/Drawing-Captcha-App-Alpha.git](https://github.com/wpesicDev/Drawing-Captcha-App-Alpha.git "https://github.com/wpesicdev/drawing-captcha-app-alpha.git")
   ```
2. Create and change your `.env` settings:

<p>I have added a `.env.example`. You can just rename this file to `.env`.</p>

   ```env
   MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
   MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootTest
   MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=drawing-captcha

   # For local development
   # MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:7500/drawing-captcha"
   # For deployment
   MONGO_URI="mongodb://${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME}:${MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD}@dc_mongo:27017/${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE}?authSource=admin"

   # Enter here your domain where you want to host your Drawing Captcha. Important: enter it with http/https
   SERVER_DOMAIN="https://yourdomain.com"

   # Port of your server
   PORT=9091

   # This will automatically be reset:
   REGISTER_KEY="&&+%&%ajkhdjhWIIWNw7>dajh2gg"

   # Change this email!!
   DC_ADMIN_EMAIL="your@mail.com"

   # Change this password!!!
   DC_ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin"
   ```

Please note to change these variables:
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
- SERVER_DOMAIN (if you want to host it somewhere)
- DC_ADMIN_EMAIL
- DC_ADMIN_PASSWORD

3. Final steps:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

<p>If you haven't changed the default port, it should be working on http://localhost:9091.</p>
